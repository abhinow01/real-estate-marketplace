# Real Estate Website

## Overview

This project is a Real Estate website where users can browse properties, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. It provides a seamless experience for users to search for properties based on location, price range, and number of bedrooms. Additionally, users can view their cart contents, remove items, and proceed to checkout.

## Approach

### Frontend
The frontend of the project is built using React.js. It leverages the React Router for navigation and state management is handled using the Context API. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a responsive and modern UI. The application is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.

### Backend
The backend of the project is simulated using mock data stored locally. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with a backend server handling requests to a database of properties. For simplicity, the mock data consists of properties with details like title, description, price, location, and number of bedrooms.
